[Deployed Project](https://googlebookreactapp.herokuapp.com)

## Project Description
---

Google Books is a MERN Full Stack Web application that gives users the tool to search for books within the Google Books API. If users want to save a book that they like, they can simply click the Save button to save it locally. This is handled with MongoDB through the mongoose package. Express router is used for fetching books from the Google Books API as well as from the local database. React Router is used to switch between the Search page and the Save page. A spinning icon is used to indicate server communication.
